# Scoring Summary

NFS scoring is a little different from most fantasy games.

Each day you choose a lineup of players based on what teams are playing that day. You choose 7 cards from your collection and slot them into their corresponding positions. You also have a 'flex' spot where you can slot any position. There are no goaltenders in NFS. Fpoints (the scoring currency of NFS) are scored based on stats for individual players (player cards), and collective team stats (team cards). Fpoints for players and teams are totaled together for the players total score after all contests have concluded.
